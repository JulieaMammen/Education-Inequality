# Do socioeconomic factors impact educational opportunities in U.S. high school?

This project aims to address the inequality of educational opportunity in U.S. high schools, focusing on student performance on the ACT or SAT exams. We aim to determine whether socioeconomic factors impact the schools' performance.

## Data

This project utilizes two data sets, the EdGap_data.xlsx, the primary data set from 2016 which contains information about average ACT or SAT scores for schools alongisde socioeconomic characteristics of the school district. The second data set contains basic information about each school from the National Center for Education Statistics.

The data set from EdGap is under the file named: 
  EdGap_data.xlsx.

The second data set ccd_Sch_029_1617_w_1a_1121017.csv is too large, but can be acccessed from the dropbox link:
